ldesc: "Although the java.net package provides basic functionality for 
accessing resources via HTTP, it doesn't provide the full flexibility or 
functionality needed by many applications. The Jakarta Commons 
HttpClient component seeks to fill this void by providing an efficient, 
up-to-date, and feature-rich package implementing the client side of the 
most recent HTTP standards and recommendations."
